<h3>Memcomputing Write-up</h3>

<p>&#8195; This article begins by talking about the inefficiencies of modern computers. The von Neumann architecture that all these computers are based on requires memory and processing to be done in different locations. This data to be transferred back and forth for the computer to carry out operations and other functions. In contrast, memcomputing is based on components that both store and process; this allows memory and processing to be done on the same components. Memcomputers have the capability to be much smaller and use much less power. In fact, the human brain functions in a very similar way where synapses both store memory and process information.</p>

<p>&#8195; The main components that are used to make computers now are transistors, capacitors and inductors (resistors are used but have less to do with the processing than these). Instead of these components, a memcomputer has memristors, memcapacitor and meminductor. They function the same except that they are altered each time that current passes through. For example, memristors changes resistance depending on the amount of current flowing through and retains the change. These components have been made but not on the scale that is required of modern computers. However, the technology is in this direction and the fab facilities that we have now do have the capability to make these components. It seems the only thing that is delaying this technology is that they need to figure out how to integrate these components into computers. The trial process is also very long.</p>
