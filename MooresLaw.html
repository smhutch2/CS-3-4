<h3>Moores Law Write-up</h3>

<p>&#8195;The director of R&D at Fairchild Semiconductor, Gordon Moore, published a prediction in 1965 that the number of transistors that could be built into a chip would double every year. His revised his statement a decade later to saying that it would double every two years. Up to this point, Moore's law has held up. For example, in 1974, Intel had a processor that had 4500 transistors while now the same size chips have 4.5 billion transistors at 14 nanometers each. However, this will not hold up in the future and chip manufactures are rethinking whether a computer chip needs a two dimensional array of wires etched into silicon. HP is no longer thinking inside of the  von Neumann box.</p>
<p>&#8195;There are many obstacles faced with trying to improve processing. For example, as transistors shrink so does the power that is required to switch them on and off. When they got smaller than 65 nanometers, they began to leak electrons and could not distinguish between on and off. There was also a frequency wall that was discovered that limited how fast CPUS could execute operations without melting. It is four billion hertz. They worked around these issues to double the number of transistors but it did not double performance. The author believes that silicon will be come a thing of the past in processor manufacturing. One thing that might replace it is graphene which is one atom thick and can make superfast transistors. Nanotubes also offer some promise, but both possibilities have their respective challenges. </p>
<p>&#8195;The von Neumann architecture doesn't fit well with many of the tasks that we need them for and so if they function like organisms do they would be more effective at these tasks. These do very well at video processing but would be terrible at logical operations. If the two types of processors the benefits of both could be harnessed.</p>
<p>&#8195;Moore's Law is about performance rather than just processors. It is function per cost. The function is what people pay for. These changes that are plausable could change what computer science is.</p>
